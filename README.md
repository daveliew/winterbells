### This is project 1 as part of my Software Engineering Immersive course with Generaly Assembly.


I've built this from Scratch using just HTML Canvas and Vanilla JS. 

Have learnt to work with:
- multiple objects 
- a generative array
- simple 2D physics
- mouse event Listeners as my controller
- understanding the interaction -> update -> render process to make the code run on the browser's requestAnimationFrame().
